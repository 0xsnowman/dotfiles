ABOUT                       *vundle-about*

*Vundle* is a short cut for Vim bundle and is the Vim plugin manager.

WHY VUNDLE                  *vunde-why-vundle*

*Vundle* allows to:

- keep track and configure your scripts right in `.vimrc`
- install configured scripts (aka bundle) 
- search [all available vim scripts] by name
- clean unused scripts up

Also as a bonus *Vundle* :

- manages runtime path of your installed scripts
- regenerates helptag atomatically

[Vundle] takes advantage of [vim-scripts.org](http://vim-scripts.org) 
in order to install/search [all available vim scripts]

SETUP                       *vundle-setup*

1. Setup [Vundle]:

        git clone http://github.com/gmarik/vundle.git ~/.vim/vundle.git

2. Configure bundles:

   Append to your `~/.vimrc`:

        set rtp+=~/.vim/vundle.git/ 
        call vundle#rc()

        " Bundles:
        Bundle "L9"
        Bundle "FuzzyFinder"
        Bundle "rails.vim"
        Bundle "ack.vim"
        Bundle "git://git.wincent.com/command-t.git"
        " ...

3. Install configured bundles:

   Launch `vim`, run `:BundleInstall` (**no `Vim` restart required** since v0.5)

   Installing requires [Git] and triggers [Git clone](http://gitref.org/creating/#clone) for each configured repo to `~/.vim/bundle/`.

SCRIPTS                 *vundle-scripts*

CONFIGURE SCRIPTS       *vundle-scripts-configure*

  
## Script installation

  `BundleInstall` installs script only if it hasn't been already installed. 
  `BundleInstall` is faster than `BundleInstall!` (note bang at the end) because latter fetches scripts without any checks. 
  Use `BundleInstall` to install new scripts. Use `BundleInstall!` to update scripts.

SEARCHING                         |*vundle-scripts-search*|

    :BundleSearch foo

lists search results in new split window, ie:

    Bundle "VimFootnotes"
    Bundle "foo.vim"

so you can just copy ones you need to `.vimrc`.

    :BundleSearch! foo

refreshes script list before performing actual search.

Searching requires [`curl`](http://curl.haxx.se/)

CLEANING UP                       |*vundle-scripts-cleanup*|

    :BundleClean

confirms removal of unused script dirs from your `.vim/bundle`. 
`BundleClean!` does that silently.
